# termdraw

Ever wanted to add a nice looking table to your text file that uses
those fancy old-school DOS-style borders? Then `termdraw` is for you!

It allows you to simply draw such borders in any text file by just moving your
cursor around. It supports single, double, and heavy borders, and also correcty
handles crossing!

Besides that, you can also just edit text :-)

## Building termdraw
`go build .`

## Running termdraw
`termdraw [filename]`
